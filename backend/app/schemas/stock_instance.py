"""Pydantic request/response schemas for StockInstance endpoints.

Schemas are thin wire DTOs; business logic lives in the service layer.
All response schemas use ``from_attributes = True`` so they can be constructed
directly from SQLAlchemy ORM objects.

Key notes (M2 Step 3):
- ``quantity`` and ``purchase_price`` are ``Decimal`` (never float) per
  roadmap §2.9.
- ``quantity`` is now nullable in both ``InstanceCreate`` and ``InstanceResponse``
  to support all three tracking modes (M2 §3.2 / §3.4):
    - ``exact`` — Decimal provided on create (initial intake); nullable in
      response (ledger-derived cache).
    - ``level`` — must be NULL; ``stock_level`` is set instead.
    - ``none`` — both NULL.
- ``InstanceUpdate`` **does not include quantity** (M2 §2 "Create vs. movement"):
  once created, an ``exact`` lot's quantity changes only through movement
  endpoints.  ``stock_level`` is included for ``level``-mode updates.
- ``serial ⇒ quantity = 1`` is enforced in the service layer (422) and at the
  DB level (CHECK constraint); these schemas accept any value and leave
  enforcement to the service.
